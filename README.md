## What Is Since I Last?

**Since I Last** is a lightweight personal tracking app that answers one simple question:

> *How long has it been since I last did this?*

Instead of rigid habits, streak pressure, or daily reminders, the app helps you **notice patterns**, **build awareness**, and **gently stay on track** with the things that matter to you — from health and training to relationships and life admin.

---

## Why It’s Different

Most habit trackers focus on:

* Daily checklists
* Streak pressure
* Over-optimization

**Since I Last** focuses on:

* Time-based awareness ("It’s been 12 days since…")
* Flexible goals instead of rigid rules
* Gentle nudges instead of nagging
* Clean, calm design that stays out of your way

It’s designed for real life — where consistency matters more than perfection.

### 🎯 Optional Goal Frequencies

Set a *rough* goal like:

* "About every 7 days"
* "Roughly twice a month"

The app uses this to:

* Show status (on track / upcoming / needs attention)
* Calculate streaks
* Suggest when you might want to do it next

No daily pressure. No punishment for missing a day.

---

### 📊 Smart Insights (No Manual Math)

As you log events, the app automatically calculates:

* Average frequency
* Time since last event
* Current streaks
* Suggested next date based on your real behavior
